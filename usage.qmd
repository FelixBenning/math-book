# Usage guide {#sec-usage-guide}

First, install [Quarto][install quarto], [LaTeX][texlive] and
[R][^why-r] . To use
this template type the following into a terminal

```sh
quarto use template FelixBenning/math-book
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Add to existing project"}

You can also use `quarto add FelixBenning/math-book` to add this template to an
existing quarto project. However to use the global macros feature, i.e. allow a
`macros.tex` file defining macros to be used in LaTeX equation, you need to
manually copy the file `_macro_processing.yml` into your root directory.
:::

For the standard features refer to [Quarto's documentation][quarto documentation]
we will focus on the special features of this template.
