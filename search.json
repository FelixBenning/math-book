    "text": "1.2 Global LaTeX Macros\nA very important feature for LaTeX users is the possibility to define custom macros. For example the following custom macros\n\\newcommand{\\real}{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\complex}{\\mathbb{C}}\ncan be used to produce \\(\\mathbb{R}\\subset \\mathbb{C}\\) from \\real \\subset \\complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the benefit of macros?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe notation for the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}= \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}\\) requires “Blackboard letters” for example. Those can be achieved using the command \\mathbb – specifically \\mathbb{N}. A custom macro may be defined as follows in LaTeX\n\\newcommand{\\nat}{\\mathbb{N}}\nObserve that such custom macros may not only be used to abbreviate commands, e.g. \\nat instead of \\mathbb{N} to produce \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), but it can also be used to create semantic placeholders for symbols that can be changed later. For example one may initially choose the letter \\(\\eta\\) to denote a step size before realizing that this letter is needed for something else. If a \\stepsize macro is used it is trivial to replace\n\\newcommand{\\stepsize}{\\eta}\nby a different letter, say \\(h\\).\n\\newcommand{\\stepsize}{h}\nAn update to the command immediately updates every occurrence of \\stepsize.\n\n\n\nThese macro definitions can be placed into a global macros.tex file and annotated with LaTeX comments. This file will be automatically included in the LaTeX target and therefore the pdf.\nUnfortunately the macros cannot be automatically included in the html target. To make sure macros also work for the html target it is necessary to add the following line to the start of any .qmd chapter file.\n{{&lt; include _macro_processing.qmd &gt;}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis templates includes the _macro_processing.qmd file in the root directory. If this template is added to an existing project, this file must be manually added to the root of the project.\n\n\nDetails about this design can be found in Section 3.1 and also in this GitHub discussion.

    "text": "1.3 Mathematical equations\nTo understand how Quarto deals with mathematical equations it is necessary to understand how equations are handled in LaTeX and html (i.e. the JavaScript libraries mathjax or KaTeX). Readers that understand equations in Quarto and their limitations may want to skip to Section 1.3.3 where the aligned-overset feature is discussed that is special to this template.\nLaTeX is built on TeX which simply toggles between ‘normal mode’ and ‘math mode’ using dollar signs e.g. $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$ renders as: \\(e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0\\). For display equations TeX allows for the use of double dollar signs, e.g.\n$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$\nwhich is rendered like this \\[\n    f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.\n\\] JavaScript libraries like mathjax or katex only implement math mode and generally scan for this dollar syntax in an html page to process it. However, at least mathjax can also be configured to work with the more advanced equation environments provided by LaTeX.\n\n1.3.1 Equations in LaTeX\nHowever LaTeX built more sophisticated display equation environments on top of this simple toggle and it is therefore not recommended to use these primitive TeX macros for display equations in LaTeX. Instead of $$ math $$ LaTeX authors are encouraged to use the syntax\n\\begin{environment}\n    math\n\\end{environment}\nHere the word environment is replaced by one of the following:\n\nequation results in a numbered display equation, equation* in an un-numbered display equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\\[...\\] is an alias for the equation* environment.\n\n\nIn contrast to the primitive TeX syntax ($$ ... $$), LaTeX equations adjusts the spacing of the equation depending on the length of the sentence before and after the equation. If the line before the equation only contains a single word, the equation is packed tighter since there is already a lot of white space to the right of this word.\nalign is a numbered display equation environment that allows the user to set alignment points with & letters. For example\n\\begin{align}\n    (a + b)^2\n    &= (a + b)(a + b) \\\\\n    &= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\\\\n    &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\end{align}\nwhich is roughly2 rendered as\n\\[\\begin{align}\n     \\tag{1}\n     (a + b)^2\n     &= (a + b)(a + b) \\\\\n     \\tag{2}\n     &= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\\\\n     \\tag{3}\n     &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe align* environment is again the un-numbered pendant which results in \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a + b)^2 &= (a + b)(a + b) \\\\\n         &= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\\\\n         &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nalignat (or alignat*) works similar to align (or align*), but allows for multiple alignment columns.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Equations in Quarto\nQuarto essentially only allows the dollar sign syntax. However, the display equations using double dollar signs ($$ ... $$) are converted to LaTeX equation environments when targeting pdf via LaTeX. More specifically, un-annotated equations are converted to un-numbered equation* environments while a ‘tagged equation’\n$$\n    f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n$$ {#eq-differentiation}\nis converted into a numbered equation\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq-differentiation}\n    f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n\\end{equation}\nrendered in html as \\[\n    f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe key @eq-differentiation can be used to produce a link (Equation 1.1).\nUnfortunately Quarto does not support aligned equations using the align environment. However it is possible to use the aligned environment inside of math mode; similarly the alignedat environment can be used in math mode in place of alignat.\nTo produce an aligned equation one can therefore use the syntax\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    (a + b)^2\n    &= (a + b)(a + b) \\\\\n    &= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\\\\n    &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-aligned-demo}\nThis renders as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    (a + b)^2\n    &= (a + b)(a + b) \\\\\n    &= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\\\\n    &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.2}\\] Observe that the ‘Quarto-way’ to tag equations only allows for one label per equation which is different from line-by-line numbering that LaTeX provides with the align environment. This is an unsolved issue at the moment.\nThere are two possible workarounds. The first workaround I strongly recommend against, under the assumption that:\n\nYou want to reference equations from different chapters.\nYou want to keep the equation preview on hover in html.\n\nI recommend the second workaround if you are willing to duplicate the equation for the few cases you actually need to reference particular lines in aligned equations. This assumes that:\n\nAligned equations explain how to get from the first element to the last. Afterwards the steps in the middle can generally be forgotten. So in the vast majority of cases it is unnecessary to label individual lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkaround 1: Ignore Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that mathjax can deal with LaTeX equation environments? Instead of the dollar syntax you can simply place naked \\begin{...} \\end{...} tags into your .qmd files. This will be correctly rendered by mathjax in html and will correctly be converted into LaTeX. But there are caveats.\nThe first caveat can be fixed: mathjax does not treat equation differently from equation* by default and omits equation numbers altogether by default. This setting can be changed and Mathjax is already configured to behave like LaTeX in this template (this is not the default of Quarto).\nBut since the mathjax equation numbering is independent of Quartos, the numbering is going to be incorrect if you use both. For this reason some authors recommend never using the Quarto syntax and only relying on mathjax for equation numbering. To do so simply use the \\label{eq-name} and \\ref{eq-name} tags you may know from LaTeX. However,\n\nmathjax cannot see anything beyond the current html page. In particular it cannot see the equations in other chapters, which makes it impossible to reference equations from other chapters with this approach.\nThe hover-over (e.g. Equation 1.2) Quarto provides will be broken\nmathjax does not know the chapter it is in, so it cannot easily use the format (1.3) where 1 refers to the chapter and 3 means it is the third equation of this chapter. The tagformat of mathjax can however be changed and this template implements a heuristic to find the correct chapter number (assumes there is only one top level heading per .qmd file).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkaround 2: Case-by-case treatment\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, you do not need to reference individual lines in an equation. The following workaround works well if you only need this in a handful of places and only reference these individual equations within the same chapter. It works by duplicating the equation and providing a version for the html target separately for a version for the pdf (i.e. LaTeX target). It looks like this:\n\\[\n    \\begin{align}\n        a &= b \\tag{a}\\\\\n        &=c \\tag{b}\n    \\end{align}\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n&lt; Text before you want to reference the equation.&gt; Equation reference: Equation 1.3 (a) \nThis is achieved using the following code that introduces a case-by-case treatment of the output\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n$$\n    \\begin{align}\n        a &= b \\tag{a}\\\\\n        &=c \\tag{b}\n    \\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-test}\n:::\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n    \\begin{align}\n        a &= b \\label{eq-a}\\\\\n        &=c \\label{eq-b}\n    \\end{align}\n:::\n\n`&lt;` Text before you want to reference the equation. `&gt;`\nEquation reference:\n[@eq-test (a)]{.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n[Equation \\ref{eq-a}]{.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\nNote that \\begin{align} is invalid syntax inside the math environment for LaTeX but it is accepted by mathjax. This allows double tags for the html target. In LaTeX you cannot have these duplicate tags, but you can use the fact that Quarto converts equation references into the LaTeX reference system and LaTeX will then take all labels into consideration and the numbering simply works. Check both outputs!\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Aligned-Overset\nA LaTeX package I love is aligned-overset. To understand what it does let me first explain the command \\overset with the following demo \\[\n    x \\overset{\\text{due to b}}{=} y.\n\\] This demo is produced by the code\n$$\n    x \\overset{\\text{due to b}}{=} y.\n$$\nThe command \\overset{over}{under} essentially places the first input over the second input. It is therefore a wonderful tool for explaining equation steps. In an aligned environment however this typically breaks alignment because the entire ‘stack’ is left-aligned if the alignment symbol & is placed before. And the explanation is usually longer than the =, like here \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    x_0\n    &= x_1\n    \\\\\n    &\\overset{\\text{due to b}}= x_2\n    \\\\\n    &= x_3.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\naligned-overset allows the placement of the alignment symbol & between the {over} and {under} of \\overset, i.e.\n\\overset{over}&{under}\nand aligns the stack only on the under part. With this feature it is possible to align the equations above like so \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    x_0\n    &= x_1\n    \\\\\n    \\overset{\\text{due to b}}&= x_2\n    \\\\\n    &= x_3\n\\end{aligned}\\] By default mathjax does not implement the aligned-overset package and therefore does not allow this placement of the alignment symbol &. However, a mathjax maintainer (Davide P. Cervone) showed me how to configure mathjax to allow this placement (see this GitHub issue). This is why the equation above works. However his solution only correctly adjusts the white-space to the right and may result in overlaps on the left, e.g. \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    x^2 \\overset{\\text{due to b}}&= y\n    \\\\\n    &= z.\n\\end{aligned}\\] Nevertheless for all equations, except for the first, this is a good solution and works out of the box with this template.\n\n\n1.3.4 Theorem environments\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Demo Theorem) Quarto provides certain theorem environments out of the box (see documentation)\n\n\nProof (proof name). Usage\n::: {#thm-demo name=\"Demo Theorem\"}\ncontent\n:::\n\n::: {.proof name=\"proof name\"}\ncontent\n:::\n\n\nTheorem 1.2 (Links work) See Theorem 1.1\n\n\nLemma 1.1 Different types of theorems however do not use the same numbering. There is no such thing as theorem groups as in LaTeX amsmath.",
