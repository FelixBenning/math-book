# Overview {.unnumbered}

This is a template for a [Quarto] math book or lecture script.
[Quarto][^quarto-history] is a framework to render Markdown documents into
`html` and via LaTeX into `pdf`. The reason you may want to target `html`
is immediately illustrated if you read the web version of this documentation.
For example, try to hover over the footnote on "Quarto",
or over the following equation reference @eq-number-hierarchy.

This interactivity is something that is impossible with `pdf`. And since LaTeX
can only really target `pdf` this is a problem.
However LaTeX is really good at equations and
other academic features that make it difficult to replace. [Quarto] provides these features.

1. It has [bibliographic reference
management](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html) that can generate
citations e.g. @knuth84 based on the cite keys in bibtex `.bibtex` and biblatex
`.bib` files. Try to hover over the citation!
2. It has machinery to
[cross-reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)
figures, tables, sections, theorems, etc.
3. And most importantly for maths, it is integrated with the [mathjax] JavaScript library that can render LaTeX equations on websites, like this one
for example:
$$
	\nat \subset \integer \subset \rational \subset \real \subset \complex
$$ {#eq-number-hierarchy}

[^quarto-history]: [Quarto] is a language agnostic the successor to [R
Markdown], both of which are built on the universal document converter [Pandoc].
[R Markdown] allowed for R code snippets to be included in a markdown document
which were executed before display. [Quarto] also allows this for Python and JavaScript.
